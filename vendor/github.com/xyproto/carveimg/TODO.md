# Plans

## Capabilities

- [ ] Add a "256-color mode" that converts images to the 256 color palette istead, and outputs truecolor terminal codes.
- [ ] Support additional image formats, like `.webp`, `.gif`, `.jpg` and especially `.ico`.

## Make it possible to configure

- [ ] If the filename should be printed on top of the image or not.
- [ ] Which rune should be used for drawing, and perhaps use different runes based on the lightness.
- [ ] If the content-aware resizing should be used or just regular resizing, and possibly also if only one axis should be resized.
